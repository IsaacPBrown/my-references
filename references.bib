  abstract = {Uncertainty remains about how the surface hydrology of the Greenland ice sheet influences its subglacial drainage system, affecting basal water pressures and ice velocities, particularly over intraseasonal and interseasonal timescales. Here we apply a high spatial (200 m) and temporal (1 h) resolution subglacial hydrological model to a marginal (extending 25 km inland), land-terminating, 200 km2 domain in the Paakitsoq region, West Greenland. The model is based on that by Hewitt (2013) but adapted for use with both real topographic boundary conditions and calibrated modeled water inputs. The inputs consist of moulin hydrographs, calculated by a surface routing and lake-filling/draining model, which is forced with distributed runoff from a surface energy-balance model. Results suggest that the areal density of lake-bottom moulins and their timing of opening during the melt season strongly affects subglacial drainage system development. A higher moulin density causes an earlier onset of subglacial channelization (i.e., water transport through channels rather than the distributed sheet), which becomes relatively widespread across the bed, whereas a lower moulin density results in a later onset of channelization that becomes less widespread across the bed. In turn, moulin density has a strong control on spatial and temporal variations in subglacial water pressures, which will influence basal sliding rates, and thus ice motion. The density of active surface-to-bed connections should be considered alongside surface melt intensity and extent in future predictions of the ice sheet's dynamics.},

  abstract = {The subglacial hydrologic system exerts strong controls on the dynamics of the overlying ice, yet the parameters that govern the evolution of this system are not widely known or observable. To gain a better understanding of these parameters, we invert a spatially averaged model of subglacial hydrology from observations of ice surface velocity and outlet stream discharge at Kennicott Glacier, Wrangell Mountains, AK, USA. To identify independent parameters, we formally non-dimensionalize the forward model. After specifying suitable prior distributions, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the distribution of parameter values conditioned on the available data. This procedure gives us not only the most probable parameter values, but also a rigorous estimate of their covariance structure. We find that the opening of cavities due to sliding over basal topography and turbulent melting are of a similar magnitude during periods of large input flux, though turbulent melting also exhibits the greatest uncertainty. We also find that both the storage of water in the englacial system and the exchange of water between englacial and subglacial systems are necessary in order to explain both surface velocity observations and the relative attenuation in the amplitude of diurnal signals between input and output flux observations.},

Here we show, using a 3D ice shelf-ocean boundary current model, that deeper basal channels can lead to a significant amplification in channelized basal melting, meltwater channeling, and warming and salinization of the channel flow. All of these channelized quantities are also modulated by channel width, with the level of modulation determined by channel height. The explicit quantification of channelized basal melting and the meltwater transport in terms of channel cross-sectional shape is potentially beneficial for the evaluation of ice shelf mass balance and meltwater contribution to the nearshore oceanography. Complicated topographically controlled circulations are revealed to be responsible for the unique thermohaline structure inside deep channels. Our study emphasizes the need for improvement in observations of evolving basal channels and the hydrography inside them, as well as adjacent to the ice front where channelized meltwater emerges.},

  abstract = {Englacial conduits act as water pathways to feed surface meltwater into the subglacial drainage system. A change of meltwater into the subglacial drainage system can alter the glacier's dynamics. Between 2012 and 2019, repeated 25\&thinsp;MHz ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys were carried out over an active englacial conduit network within the ablation area of the temperate Rhonegletscher, Switzerland. In 2012, 2016, and 2017 GPR measurements were carried out only once a year, and an englacial conduit was detected in 2017. In 2018 and 2019 the repetition survey rate was increased to monitor seasonal variations in the detected englacial conduit. The resulting GPR data were processed using an impedance inversion workflow to compute GPR reflection coefficients and layer impedances, which are indicative of the conduit's infill material. The spatial and temporal evolution of the reflection coefficients also provided insights into the morphology of the Rhonegletscher's englacial conduit network. During the summer melt seasons, we observed an active, water-filled, sediment-transporting englacial conduit network that yielded large negative GPR reflection coefficients (\&lt;-0.2). The GPR surveys conducted during the summer provided evidence that the englacial conduit was 15–20 m±6 m wide, ∼0.4m±0.35m thick, ∼250m±6m long with a shallow inclination (2∘), and having a sinusoidal shape from the GPR data. We speculate that extensional hydraulic fracturing is responsible for the formation of the conduit as a result of the conduit network geometry observed and from borehole observations. Synthetic GPR waveform modelling using a thin water-filled conduit showed that a conduit thickness larger than 0.4\&thinsp;m (0.3× minimum wavelength) thick can be correctly identified using 25\&thinsp;MHz GPR data. During the winter periods, the englacial conduit no longer transports water and either physically closed or became very thin (\&lt;0.1\&thinsp;m), thereby producing small negative reflection coefficients that are caused by either sediments lying within the closed conduit or water within the very thin conduit. Furthermore, the englacial conduit reactivated during the following melt season at an identical position as in the previous year.},

  abstract = {Subglacial drainage plays an important role in controlling coupling between glacial ice and underlying bed. Here, we study the flow of water in thin, macroporous sheets between ice and bed. Previous work shows that small perturbations in depth of a nearly parallel-sided water film grow unstably because these areas have enhanced viscous dissipation that leads to enhanced melting of an ice roof. We argue that in the presence of bed protrusions bridging a water sheet, downward motion of the ice roof can stabilize this sheet. Stability results when the rate of roof closure increases faster with water depth than the rate of viscous dissipation. We therefore modify existing theory to include protrusions that partially support the overlying glacier. Differences in the pressure on protrusions relative to water pressure drive roof closure. The mechanisms of both regelation and creep normal to the bed close the overlying ice roof and decrease the ice-bed gap. In order to account for multiple protrusion sizes along the bed (for instance, resulting from an assortment of various-sized sediment grains), we incorporate a method of partitioning overburden pressure among different protrusion size classes and the water sheet. Partitioning is dependent on the amount of ice protrusion contact and, therefore, water depth. This method allows prediction of roof closure rates. We then investigate stable, steady sheet configurations for reasonable parameter choices and find that these steady states can occur for modest water depths at very low effective pressures, as is appropriate for ice streams. Moreover, we find that multiple steady sheet thicknesses exist, raising the possibility of switches between low and high hydraulic conductivity regimes for the subglacial water system.},

  abstract = {We analyse the cross-sectional evolution of an englacial meltwater conduit that contracts due to inward creep of the surrounding ice and expands due to melting. Making use of theoretical methods from free-boundary problems in Stokes flow and Hele–Shaw squeeze flow we construct an exact solution to the coupled problem of external viscous creep and internal heating, in which we adopt a Newtonian approximation for ice flow and an idealized uniform heat source in the conduit. This problem provides an interesting variant on standard free-boundary problems, coupling different internal and external problems through the kinematic condition at the interface. The boundary in the exact solution takes the form of an ellipse that may contract or expand (depending on the magnitudes of effective pressure and heating rate) around fixed focal points. Linear stability analysis reveals that without the melting this solution is unstable to perturbations in the shape. Melting can stabilize the interface unless the aspect ratio is too small; in that case, instabilities grow largest at the thin ends of the ellipse. The predictions are corroborated with numerical solutions using boundary integral techniques. Finally, a number of extensions to the idealized model are considered, showing that a contracting circular conduit is unstable to all modes of perturbation if melting occurs at a uniform rate around the boundary, or if the ice is modelled as a shear-thinning fluid.},

  abstract = {Subglacial hydrology plays a key role in many glaciological processes, including ice dynamics via the modulation of basal sliding. Owing to the lack of an overarching theory, however, a variety of model approximations exist to represent the subglacial drainage system. The Subglacial Hydrology Model Intercomparison Project (SHMIP) provides a set of synthetic experiments to compare existing and future models. We present the results from 13 participating models with a focus on effective pressure and discharge. For many applications (e.g. steady states and annual variations, low input scenarios) a simple model, such as an inefficient-system-only model, a flowline or lumped model, or a porouslayer model provides results comparable to those of more complex models. However, when studying short term (e.g. diurnal) variations of the water pressure, the use of a two-dimensional model incorporating physical representations of both efficient and inefficient drainage systems yields results that are significantly different from those of simpler models and should be preferentially applied. The results also emphasise the role of water storage in the response of water pressure to transient recharge. Finally, we find that the localisation of moulins has a limited impact except in regions of sparse moulin density.},

  abstract = {The focus of this study is to analyse the tip region of a hydraulic fracture, for which a fluid flow inside the crack transitions from the laminar to the turbulent regime away from the tip. To tackle the problem, a phenomenological formula for flow in pipes has been adapted to describe flow in a fracture through the concept of a hydraulic diameter. The selected model is able to capture laminar, turbulent and transition regimes of the flow. The near-tip region of a hydraulic fracture is analysed by focusing on steady propagation of a semi-infinite hydraulic fracture with leak-off, for which the aforementioned phenomenological formula for the fluid flow is utilized. First, the distance from the tip within which a laminar solution applies is estimated. Then, expressions for asymptotic solutions that are associated with fully developed turbulent flow inside the semi-infinite hydraulic fracture are derived. Finally, the laminar zone size and the asymptotic solutions are compared with the numerical solution, where the latter captures all regimes of the fluid flow.},

A large fraction of uncertainty in future sea level rise comes from limited understanding of basal conditions under ice sheets. Specifically, subglacial hydrology, which describes the volume and movement of meltwater underneath glaciers and resulting basal water pressures. This system exerts a strong control on ice basal sliding and the rate of ice shelf melt, both of which can destabilize glaciers and lead to enhanced sea level rise. Here, we present subglacial hydrology model results of the full Antarctic Ice Sheet derived using the Glacier Drainage System model.

  abstract = {Significance             The Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass at an accelerating rate, and playing a more important role in terms of global sea-level rise. The Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica has most likely been destabilized. Although previous numerical modeling studies examined the short-term future evolution of this region, here we take the next step and simulate the long-term evolution of the whole West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Our results show that if the Amundsen Sea sector is destabilized, then the entire marine ice sheet will discharge into the ocean, causing a global sea-level rise of about 3 m. We thus might be witnessing the beginning of a period of self-sustained ice discharge from West Antarctica that requires long-term global adaptation of coastal protection.           ,              The future evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet represents the largest uncertainty in sea-level projections of this and upcoming centuries. Recently, satellite observations and high-resolution simulations have suggested the initiation of an ice-sheet instability in the Amundsen Sea sector of West Antarctica, caused by the last decades’ enhanced basal ice-shelf melting. Whether this localized destabilization will yield a full discharge of marine ice from West Antarctica, associated with a global sea-level rise of more than 3 m, or whether the ice loss is limited by ice dynamics and topographic features, is unclear. Here we show that in the Parallel Ice Sheet Model, a local destabilization causes a complete disintegration of the marine ice in West Antarctica. In our simulations, at 5-km horizontal resolution, the region disequilibrates after 60 y of currently observed melt rates. Thereafter, the marine ice-sheet instability fully unfolds and is not halted by topographic features. In fact, the ice loss in Amundsen Sea sector shifts the catchment's ice divide toward the Filchner–Ronne and Ross ice shelves, which initiates grounding-line retreat there. Our simulations suggest that if a destabilization of Amundsen Sea sector has indeed been initiated, Antarctica will irrevocably contribute at least 3 m to global sea-level rise during the coming centuries to millennia.},

  abstract = {Glaciers are huge and slow moving rivers of ice which exist in various parts of the world: Alaska, the Rockies, the Alps, Spitsbergen, China, for example. They drain areas in which snow accumulates, much as rivers drain catchment areas where rain falls. Glaciers also flow in the same basic way that rivers do. Although glacier ice is solid, it can deform by the slow creep of dislocations within the lattice of ice crystals which form the fabric of the ice. Thus, glacier ice effectively behaves like a viscous material, with, however, a very large viscosity: a typical value of ice viscosity is 1 bar year (in the metre-bar-year system of units!). Since 1 bar = 105 Pa, 1 year ≈ 3 × 107 s, this is a viscosity of some 1012 Pa s, about 1015 times that of water. As a consequence of their enormous viscosity, glaciers move slowly - a typical velocity would be in the range 10–100 m y-1 (metres per year), certainly measurable but hardly dramatic. More awesome are the dimensions of glaciers. Depths of hundreds of metres are typical, widths of kilometres, lengths of tens of kilometres. Thus glaciers can have an important effect on the human environment in their vicinity. They are also indirect monitors of climate; for example, many lithographs of Swiss glaciers show that they have been receding since the nineteenth century, a phenomena thought to be due to the termination of the `little ice age' in the middle ages.},

  abstract = {This paper is an attempt at a mathematical synopsis of the theory of wave motions on glaciers. These comprise surface waves (analogous to water waves) and seasonal waves (more like compression waves). Surface waves have been often treated and are well understood, but seasonal waves, while observed, do not seem to have attracted any theoretical explanation. Additionally, the spectacular phenomenon of glacier surges, while apparently a dynamic phenomenon, has not been satisfactorily explained.             The present thesis is that the two wave motions (and probably also surging, though a discussion of this is not developed here) can both be derived from a rational theory based on conservation laws of mass and momentum, provided that the basal kinematic boundary condition involving boundary slip is taken to have a certain reasonable form. It is the opinion of this author that the form of this ‘sliding law’ is the crux of the difference between seasonal and surface waves, and that a further understanding of these motions must be based on a more satisfactory analysis of basal sliding.             Since ice is here treated in the context of a slow, shallow, non-Newtonian fluid flow, the theory that emerges is that of non-Newtonian viscous shallow-water theory; rather than balance inertia terms with gravity in the momentum equation, we balance the shear-stress gradient. The resulting set of equationsis, in essence, a first-order nonlinear hyperbolic (kinematic) wave equation, and susceptible to various kinds of analysis. We show how both surface and seasonal waves are naturally described by such a model when the basal boundary condition is appropriately specified. Shocks can naturally occur, and we identify the (small) diffusive parameters that are present, and give the shock structure: in so doing, we gain a useful understanding of the effects of surface slope and longitudinal stress in these waves.},

We review recent advances in understanding the changing stability of the ice sheet margins and identify key processes that require further research.

  abstract = {Under some conditions of temperature and flow an ice-water interface in the presence of a turbulent stream has been observed to be unstable. In this paper the source and the conditions for the instability were investigated for a well-defined turbulent boundary-layer flow. It was found that the instability resulted from the interaction that occurs between a wavy surface and a turbulent flow over it. Such an interaction results in a heat transfer variation which is 90 to 180 degrees out of phase with the surface wave shape – a result which is consistent with the calculations of Thorsness \& Hanratty (1979               a               ,               b               ).                          The main factor controlling damping of the instability at an ice-water interface was found to be the rate at which heat is conducted away from the interface into the ice.                            In the past it has been found that when an ice layer is melting, that is when the heat conduction in the ice is small, the ice surface is highly unstable. In the present study it was found that for a sufficiently large temperature ratio (               T                                f                              −               T                                w                              )/(               T               ∞               −               T                                f                              ), a steady-state ice layer is also unstable. Furthermore it is predicted, from the present observations, that a growing ice layer with a ratio of ice-side to water-side heat fluxes of up to 2.3 could be unstable.                          Under sufficiently unstable conditions waves on the ice surface grow to an amplitude at which flow separations occur near the wave crests. This results in a ‘rippled’ ice surface pattern very similar to the patterns observed on mobile bed surfaces (Kennedy 1969) or surfaces which are being dissolved into a flowing stream (Allen 1971). The development of a ‘rippled’ ice surface results in a very substantial increase in the mean heat-transfer rate which would have an important influence on predictions of ice formation in the presence of a turbulent stream.},

  abstract = {Creep experiments on fine-grained ice reveal the existence of three creep regimes: (1) a dislocation creep regime, (2) a superplastic flow regime in which grain boundary sliding is an important deformation process, and (3) a basal slip creep regime in which the strain rate is limited by basal slip. Dislocation creep in ice is likely climb-limited, is characterized by a stress exponent of 4.0, and is independent of grain size. Superplastic flow is characterized by a stress exponent of 1.8 and depends inversely on grain size to the 1.4 power. Basal slip limited creep is characterized by a stress exponent of 2.4 and is independent of grain size. A fourth creep mechanism, diffusional flow, which usually occurs at very low stresses, is inaccessible at practical laboratory strain rates even for our finest grain sizes of ∼3 μm. A constitutive equation based on these experimental results that includes flow laws for these four creep mechanisms is described. This equation is in excellent agreement with published laboratory creep data for coarse-grained samples at high temperatures. Superplastic flow of ice is the rate-limiting creep mechanism over a wide range of temperatures and grain sizes at stresses ≲0.1 MPa, conditions which overlap those occurring in glaciers, ice sheets, and icy planetary interiors.},

  abstract = {Iceberg meltwater is a critical freshwater flux from the cryosphere to the oceans. Global climate simulations therefore require simple and accurate parameterisations of iceberg melting. Iceberg shape is an important but often neglected aspect of iceberg melting. Icebergs have an enormous range of shapes and sizes, and distinct processes dominate basal and side melting. We show how different iceberg aspect ratios and relative ambient water velocities affect melting using a combined experimental and numerical study. The experimental results show significant variations in melting between different iceberg faces, as well as within each iceberg face. These findings are reproduced and explained with novel multiphysics numerical simulations. At high relative ambient velocities melting is largest on the side facing the flow, and mixing during vortex generation causes local increases in basal melt rates of over 50\%. Double-diffusive buoyancy effects become significant when the relative ambient velocity is low. Existing melting parameterisations do not reproduce our findings. We propose several corrections to capture the influence of aspect ratio on iceberg melting.},

The sheet represents the average effect of many linked cavities, whilst the channels emerge from individual cavities that enlarge due to dissipationinduced melting. The model distinguishes cases when the water pressure drops to zero, in which case it allows for the drainage space to be only partially filled with water (free surface flow), and when the pressure reaches the ice overburden pressure, in which case it allows for uplift of the ice to whatever extent is needed to accommodate the water (flotation). Numerical solutions are found for a one-dimensional flow-line version of the model. The results capture typically observed or inferred features of subglacial drainage systems, including open channel flow at the ice margin, seasonal channel evolution, and high water pressures and uplift of the ice surface driven by rapid changes in water supply.},

  abstract = {We develop a model of the rapid propagation of water at the contact between elastic glacial ice and a poroelastic subglacial till, motivated by observations of the rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes in Greenland. By treating the ice as an elastic bending beam, the fluid dynamics of contact with the subglacial hydrological network, which is modelled as a saturated poroelastic till, can be examined in detail. The model describes the formation and dynamics of an axisymmetric subglacial cavity, and the spread of pore pressure, in response to injection of fluid. A combination of numerical simulation and asymptotic analysis is used to describe these dynamics for both a rigid and a deformable porous till, and for both laminar and turbulent fluid flow. For constant injection rates and laminar flow, the cavity is isostatic and its spread is controlled by bending of the ice and suction of pore water in the vicinity of the ice–till contact. For a deformable till, this control can be modified: generically, a flexural wave that is initially trapped in advance of the contact point relaxes over time by diffusion of pore pressure ahead of the cavity. While the dynamics are found to be relatively insensitive to the properties of the subglacial till during injection with a constant flux, significant dependence on the till properties is manifest during the subsequent spread of a constant volume. A simple hybrid turbulent–laminar model is presented to account for fast injection rates of water: in this case, self-similar turbulent propagation can initially control the spread of the cavity, but there is a transition to laminar control in the vicinity of the ice–till contact point as the flow slows. Finally, the model results are compared with recent geophysical observations of the rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes in Greenland; the comparison provides qualitative agreement and raises suggestions for future quantitative comparison.},

  abstract = {Models are proposed for channelized and distributed flow of meltwater at the base of an ice sheet. The volumes of both channel and distributed systems evolve according to a competition between processes that open drainage space (e.g. sliding over bedrock, melting of the ice) and processes that close it (e.g. viscous creep of the ice due to a positive effective pressure). Channels are generally predicted to have lower water pressure and therefore capture water from the surrounding regions of distributed flow. There is a natural length scale associated with the distributed system that determines the width of the bed from which water can be drawn into a channel. It is suggested that this determines the spacing between major channels and that this may be reflected in the spacing of eskers. A more permeable distributed system results in more widely spaced, and therefore larger, channels. Calculations of the flow into the head of a channel reveal that there is a critical discharge necessary for it to form, and provide a criterion for where channels can exist.},

The model describes the evolution of the drainage system and its coupling with ice flow through a sliding law that depends on the effective pressure. The results predict ice acceleration during early summer when the inefficient drainage system is temporarily overwhelmed. The growth of a more efficient drainage system leads to a subsequent slowdown of the ice very close to the margin, but high water pressure and ice velocity are maintained through much of the summer further inland. Annual mean ice velocity increases with the total quantity of melt water except close to the margin, where it is almost insensitive to the amount of melting. Short-term variability of melt water input leads to rapid changes in ice velocity that result in a slight increase in the mean velocity relative to a smoother input. Linked-cavity and poroelastic models for the distributed drainage system are compared, and their relative merits discussed. Two different sliding laws are considered, and the need for a holistic description of hydraulically controlled sliding is highlighted.},

We modify the standard sheet-flow parameterization within a coupled sheet--channel subglacial drainage model to smoothly transition between laminar and turbulent flow based on the locally computed Reynolds number in a physically consistent way (the “transition”' model). We compare the transition model to standard laminar and turbulent models to assess the role of the sheet-flow parameterization in reconciling observed and modelled water pressures under idealized and realistic forcing. Relative to the turbulent model, the laminar and transition models improve seasonal simulations in four distinct ways: they (1) increase winter water pressure by 25–35\%, (2) produce late-summer water pressure below the winter baseline, (3) decrease the peak spring water pressure, and (4) reduce the duration of water pressure exceeding overburden. In contrast to the laminar model, the transition model remains consistent with its own internal assumptions across all flow regimes. Based on the improved performance and internal consistency of the transition model, we recommend its use for transient simulations of subglacial drainage.},

Good agreement between measured and calculated pressures can be obtained by assuming that the cross-sectional shape of conduits resembles the space between the arc of a circle and its chord. The angle subtended by the arc, θ, is treated as an adjustable parameter. In four cases studied, θ ranged from 2° to 36°.},

This form is observed1,2 to be stable to any small disturbances which are initiated on the front due, for example, to irregularities in the horizontal surface or to chance perturbations. Alternatively, if some fluid is released onto a sloping surface—for example, some liquid detergent on a slanted plate—a quite different plan form occurs. One, two or more extended regions of fluid develop downslope, as shown in Fig. 1a, b. A situation intermediate between these two is now discussed. Consider a broad band of viscous fluid, uniform in depth across a slope, released so as to flow down a constant slope. By following the motion, which is initially independent of the cross-slope coordinate, the speed of advance and the depth of the flow before it breaks up into a series of waves of ever increasing amplitude can be determined. I present an expression for the wavelength of the front, which is determined by surface tension and is independent of the coefficient of viscosity.},

  abstract = {The manner by which meltwater drains through a glacier is critical to ice dynamics, runoff characteristics, and water quality. However, much of the contemporary knowledge relating to glacier hydrology has been based upon, and conditioned by, understanding gleaned from temperate valley glaciers. Globally, a significant proportion of glaciers and ice sheets exhibit nontemperate thermal regimes. The recent, growing concern over the future response of polar glaciers and ice sheets to forecasts of a warming climate and lengthening summer melt season necessitates recognition of the hydrological processes in these nontemperate ice masses. It is therefore timely to present an accessible review of the scientific progress in glacial hydrology where nontemperate conditions are dominant. This review provides an appraisal of the glaciological literature from nontemperate glaciers, examining supraglacial, englacial, and subglacial environments in sequence and their role in hydrological processes within glacierized catchments. In particular, the variability and complexity in glacier thermal regimes are discussed, illustrating how a unified model of drainage architecture is likely to remain elusive due to structural controls on the presence of water. Cold ice near glacier surfaces may reduce meltwater flux into the glacier interior, but observations suggest that the transient thermal layer of near surface ice holds a hydrological role as a depth-limited aquifer. Englacial flowpaths may arise from the deep incision of supraglacial streams or the propagation of hydrofractures, forms which are readily able to handle varied meltwater discharge or act as locations for water storage, and result in spatially discrete delivery of water to the subglacial environment. The influence of such drainage routes on seasonal meltwater release is explored, with reference to summer season upwellings and winter icing formation. Moreover, clear analogies emerge between nontemperate valley glacier and ice sheet hydrology, the discussion of which indicates how persistent reassessment of our conceptualization of glacier drainage systems is required. There is a clear emphasis that continued, integrated endeavors focused on process glaciology at nontemperate glaciers are a scientific imperative to augmenting the existing body of research centered on ice mass hydrology.},

In this first part of the study dealing with stability analysis, the basic equations and the parameters governing the problem in a rectilinear geometry are developed. An exponential dependence of viscosity on temperature and concentration is represented by two parameters, thermal mobility ratio βT and a solutal mobility ratio βC , respectively. Other parameters involved are the Lewis number Le and a thermal-lag coefficient λ. The governing equations are linearized and solved to obtain instability characteristics using either a quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) or initial value calculations (IVC). Exact analytical solutions are also obtained for very weakly diffusing systems. Using the QSSA approach, it was found that an increase in thermal mobility ratio βT is seen to enhance the instability for fixed βC , Le and λ. For fixed βC and βT , a decrease in the thermal-lag coefficient and/or an increase in the Lewis number always decrease the instability. Moreover, strong thermal diffusion at large Le as well as enhanced redistribution of heat between the solid and fluid phases at small λ is seen to alleviate the destabilizing effects of positive βT . Consequently, the instability gets strictly dominated by the solutal front. The linear stability analysis using IVC approach leads to conclusions similar to the QSSA approach except for the case of large Le and unity λ flow where the instability is seen to get even less pronounced than in the case of a reference isothermal flow of the same βC , but βT = 0. At practically, small value of λ, however, the instability ultimately approaches that due to βC only.},

  abstract = {The sliding speed of glaciers depends strongly on the water pressure at the ice‐sediment interface, which is controlled by the efficiency of water transport through a subglacial hydrological system. The least efficient component of the system consists of “distributed” flow everywhere beneath the ice, whereas the “channelized” drainage through large, thermally eroded conduits is more efficient. To understand the conditions under which the subglacial network channelizes, we perform a linear stability analysis of distributed flow, considering competition between thermal erosion and viscous ice collapse. The calculated growth rate gives a stability criterion, describing the minimum subglacial meltwater flux needed for channels to form, but also indicates the tendency to generate infinitely narrow channels in existing models. We demonstrate the need to include lateral heat diffusion when modeling melt incision to resolve channel widths, which allows continuum models to recover Röthlisberger channel behavior. We also show that low numerical resolution can suppress channel formation and lead to overestimates of water pressure. Our derived channelization criterion can be used to predict the character of subglacial hydrological systems without recourse to numerical simulations, with practical implications for understanding changes in ice velocity due to changes in surface melt runoff.},

  abstract = {Based on observations of the 1982–1983 surge of Variegated Glacier, Alaska, a model of the surge mechanism is developed in terms of a transition from the normal tunnel configuration of the basal water conduit system to a linked cavity configuration that tends to restrict the flow of water, resulting in increased basal water pressures that cause rapid basal sliding. The linked cavity system consists of basal cavities formed by ice-bedrock separation (cavitation), ∼1 m high and ∼10 m in horizontal dimensions, widely scattered over the glacier bed, and hydraulically linked by narrow connections where separation is minimal (separation gap ≲ 0.1 m). The narrow connections, called orifices, control the water flow through the conduit system; by throttling the flow through the large cavities, the orifices keep the water flux transmitted by the basal water system at normal levels even though the total cavity cross-sectional area (∼200 m2) is much larger than that of a tunnel system (∼10 m2). A physical model of the linked cavity system is formulated in terms of the dimensions of the “typical” cavity and orifice and the numbers of these across the glacier width. The model concentrates on the detailed configuration of the typical orifice and its response to basal water pressure and basal sliding, which determines the water flux carried by the system under given conditions. Configurations are worked out for two idealized orifice types, step orifices that form in the lee of downglacier-facing bedrock steps, and wave orifices that form on the lee slopes of quasisinusoidal bedrock waves and are similar to transverse “N channels.” The orifice configurations are obtained from the results of solutions of the basal-sliding-with-separation problem for an ice mass constituting of linear half-space of linear rheology, with nonlinearity introduced by making the viscosity stress-dependent on an intuitive basis. Modification of the orifice shapes by melting of the ice roof due to viscous heat dissipation in the flow of water through the orifices is treated in detail under the assumption of local heat transfer, which guarantees that the heating effects are not underestimated. This treatment brings to light a melting-stability parameter Ξ that provides a measure of the influence of viscous heating on orifice cavitation, similar but distinct for step and wave orifices. Orifice shapes and the amounts of roof meltback are determined by Ξ. When Ξ ≳ 1, so that the system is “viscous-heating-dominated,” the orifices are unstable against rapid growth in response to a modest increase in water pressure or in orifice size over their steady state values. This growth instability is somewhat similar to the jökulhlaup-type instability of tunnels, which are likewise heating-dominated. When Ξ ≲ 1, the orifices are stable against perturbations of modest to even large size. Stabilization is promoted by high sliding velocity ν, expressed in terms of a ν−½ and ν−1 dependence of Ξ for step and wave cavities. The relationships between basal water pressure and water flux transmitted by linked cavity models of step and wave orifice type are calculated for an empirical relation between water pressure and sliding velocity and for a particular, reasonable choice of system parameters. In all cases the flux is an increasing function of the water pressure, in contrast to the inverse flux-versus-pressure relation for tunnels. In consequence, a linked cavity system can exist stably as a system of many interconnected conduits distributed across the glacier bed, in contrast to a tunnel system, which must condense to one or at most a few main tunnels. The linked cavity model gives basal water pressures much higher than the tunnel model at water fluxes ≳1 m3/s if the bed roughness features that generate the orifices have step heights or wave amplitudes less than about 0.1 m. The calculated basal water pressure of the particular linked cavity models evaluated is about 2 to 5 bars below ice overburden pressure for water fluxes in the range from about 2 to 20 m3/s, which matches reasonably the observed conditions in Variegated Glacier in surge; in contrast, the calculated water pressure for a single-tunnel model is about 14 to 17 bars below overburden over the same flux range. The contrast in water pressures for the two types of basal conduit system furnishes the basis for a surge mechanism involving transition from a tunnel system at low pressure to a linked cavity system at high pressure. The parameter Ξ is about 0.2 for the linked cavity models evaluated, meaning that they are stable but that a modest change in system parameters could produce instability. Unstable orifice growth results in the generation of tunnel segments, which may connect up in a cooperative fashion, leading to conversion of the linked cavity system to a tunnel system, with large decrease in water pressure and sliding velocity. This is what probably happens in surge termination. Glaciers for which Ξ ≲ 1 can go into surge, while those for which Ξ ≳ 1 cannot. Because Ξ varies as α3/2 (where α is surface slope), low values of Ξ are more probable for glaciers of low slope, and because slope correlates inversely with glacier length in general, the model predicts a direct correlation between glacier length and probability of surging; such a correlation is observed (Clarke et al., 1986). Because Ξ varies inversely with the basal shear stress τ, the increase of τ that takes place in the reservoir area in the buildup between surges causes a decrease in Ξ there, which, by reducing Ξ below the critical value ∼1, can allow surge initiation and the start of a new surge cycle. Transition to a linked cavity system without tunnels should occur spontaneously at low enough water flux, in agreement with observed surge initiation in winter.},

  abstract = {Meltwater routing through ice masses exerts a fundamental control over glacier dynamics and mass balance, and proglacial hydrology. However, despite recent advances in mapping drainage systems in cold, Arctic glaciers, direct observations of englacial channels and their flow conditions remain sparse. Here, using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) surveys of the main englacial channel of cold-based Austre Brøggerbreen (Svalbard), we map and compare an entrance moulin reach (122 m long) and exit portal reach (273 m long). Analysis of channel planforms, longitudinal profiles, cross-sections and morphological features reveals evidence of spatial variations in water flow conditions and channel incision mechanisms, and the presence of vadose, epiphreatic and phreatic conditions. The entrance reach, located at the base of a perennial moulin, was characterized by vadose, uniform, channel lowering at annual timescales, evidenced by longitudinal grooves, whereas the exit portal reach showed both epiphreatic and vadose conditions, along with upstream knickpoint migration at intra-annual timescales. Fine-scale features, including grooves and scallops, were readily quantified from the TLS point cloud, highlighting the capacity of the technique to inform palaeoflow conditions, and reveal how pulses of meltwater from rainfall events may adjust englacial conduit behaviour. With forecasts of increasing Arctic precipitation in the coming decades, and a progressively greater proportion of glaciers comprising cold ice, augmenting the current knowledge of englacial channel morphology is essential to constrain future glacier hydrological system change.},

The hydrological model is tested on an idealized marine ice sheet and subsequently applied to 5 the drainage basin of Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, that is composed of a heterogeneous (hard/soft) bed. We find that subglacial hydrology embedded in the sliding law accelerates the grounding line retreat of Thwaites Glacier under present-day climatic conditions. Highest retreat rates are obtained for hard bed configurations and/or inefficient drainage systems. We show that the sensitivity is particularly driven by large gradients in effective pressure, more so than the value of effective pressure itself in the vicinity of the grounding line. Clearly, a better understanding of the subglacial system is needed with respect to 10 both the spatial and temporal variability in effective pressure and bed rheological conditions.},

  abstract = {The steady, coaxial flow in which two immiscible, incompressible fluids of differing densities move past each other slowly in a vertical cylindrical tube has a continuum of possibilities due to the arbitrariness of the interface between the fluids. By invoking the presence of surface tension to at least restrict the shape of any interface to that of a circular arc or full circle, we consider the following question: which flow will maximise the exchange when there is only one dividing interface Γ? Surprisingly, the answer differs fundamentally from the better-known co-directional two-phase flow situation where an axisymmetric (concentric) core-annular solution always optimises the flux. Instead, the maximal flux state is invariably asymmetric either being a ‘side-by-side’ configuration where Γ starts and finishes at the tube wall or an               eccentric               core-annular flow where Γ is an off-centre full circle in which the more viscous fluid is surrounded by the less viscous fluid. The side-by-side solution is the most efficient exchanger for a small viscosity ratio β ≲ 4.60 with an eccentric core-annular solution optimal otherwise. At large β, this eccentric solution provides 51\% more flux than the axisymmetric core-annular flow which is always a local minimiser of the flux.},

We examine the origin of the instability by asking whether the instability is an internal instability, arising from internal dynamics, or a frontal instability, arising from viscous intrusion. We find it is the latter and characterise the instability criterion in terms of viscosity difference or, equivalently, the jump in hydrostatic pressure gradient at the intrusion front. The mechanism of this instability is similar to, but contrasts with, the Saffman–Taylor instability, which occurs as a result of a jump in dynamic pressure gradient across the intrusion front. We focus on the limit in which the two viscous fluids are of equal density, in which a frontal singularity, arising at the intrusion, or lubrication, front, becomes a jump discontinuity, and perform a local analysis in an inner region near the lubrication front, which we match asymptotically to the far field. We also investigate the large-wavenumber stabilisation by transverse shear stresses in two dynamical regimes: a regime in which the wavelength of the perturbations is much smaller than the thickness of both layers of fluid, in which case the flow of the perturbations is resisted dominantly by horizontal shear stresses; and an intermediate regime, in which both vertical and horizontal shear stresses are important.},

We investigate the coupled flow of a gravity current (GC) of a strain-rate softening fluid that is lubricated by a denser, lower-viscosity Newtonian fluid. We present a set of experiments in which such GCs are discharged axisymmetrically and at constant flux over a flat surface. Using imaging techniques, we follow the evolution of the front and thickness field of each fluid. We find that, unlike purely Newtonian lubricated GCs, the fronts of the non-Newtonian and lubricating Newtonian fluids have a power-law time evolution with different exponents. Each of these exponents is similar to that of a non-lubricated GC of the same fluid. Nevertheless, the fronts of our lubricated GCs evolve faster than those of the corresponding non-lubricated GCs owing to larger intercepts. In addition, in contrast with the monotonically declining thickness of non-lubricated GCs, the thickness of the lubricated, non-Newtonian fluid is nearly uniform, and that of the lubricating fluid is non-monotonic with localised spikes. Despite these complex thickness patterns, lubricated GCs remain axisymmetric as long as the flux of the lubricating fluid is sufficiently smaller than that of the non-Newtonian fluid.},

However, the effect of channel position and shape on ice-shelf flow has not been systematically explored. We use a model to show that, as expected, channels concentrate deformation and increase ice-shelf flow speeds, in some cases by over 100\% at the ice-shelf center and over 80\% at the grounding line. The resulting increase in shear can cause stresses around the channels to exceed the threshold for failure, suggesting that rifting, calving and retreat might result. However, channels have different effects depending on their width, depth and position on an ice shelf. Channels in areas where ice shelves are spreading freely have little effect on ice flow, and even channels in confined regions of the shelf do not necessarily alter flow significantly. Nevertheless, if located in areas of vulnerability, particularly in the shear margins near the grounding line, melt channels may alter flow in a way that could lead to catastrophic ice-shelf breakup by mechanically separating shelves from their embayments.},

  abstract = {It is remarkable that the high-end sea level rise threat over the next few hundred years comes almost entirely from only a handful of ice streams and large glaciers. These occupy a few percent of ice sheets’ coastline. Accordingly, spatially limited interventions at source may provide globally-equitable mitigation from rising seas. Ice streams control draining of ice sheets; glacier retreat or acceleration serves to greatly increase potential sea level rise. While various climatic geoengineering approaches have been considered, serious consideration of geotechnical approaches has been limited e particularly regarding glaciers. This study summarises novel and extant geotechnical techniques for glacier restraint, identifying candidates for further research. These include draining or freezing the bed; altering surface albedo; creating obstacles: retaining snow; stiffening shear margins with ice; blocking warm sea water entry; thickening ice shelves (increasing buttressing, and strengthening fractured shelves against disintegration); as well as using regional climate engineering or local cloud seeding to cool the glacier or add snow. Not all of these ideas are judged reasonable or feasible, and even fewer are likely to be found to be advisable after further consideration. By describing and evaluating the potential and risks of a large menu of responses e even apparently hopeless ones e we can increase the chances of finding one that works in times of need.},

  abstract = {The Viedma glacier is the largest glacier in Argentina and one of the most dynamic in the Southern Patagonian Icefield. It is a strategic water source. This study analyzes the interactions of glaciological variables that help better explain the behavior of the Viedma glacier. This paper presents the study of surface flow speed and ice surface temperatures during the 2015–2016 warm season by using remote sensing data and includes the statistical correlation between those variables. In addition, a reconstruction of the front fluctuation between 1979 and 2016 through CORONA and LANDSAT images is included. Finally, the displacement modes dominating the Viedma glacier are suggested. Our results showed that the mean surface flow speed during the study period was of around 1.2 ± 0.3 md−1 and reached maximum values of 5.5 ± 0.3 md−1 and 3 ± 0.3 md−1 at middle basin and terminus respectively. Thermal data revealed minimum values of −2 °C in the uppermost section of the study area, whilst the glacier's terminus showed supraglacial melt (values above pressure melting point). Front fluctuation analysis revealed the largest front retraction of the last 40 years between 2010 and 2016: around 281 my−1. Statistical correlation analysis and glaciological data suggested that the middle and lower basins of the Viedma glacier are widely dominated by basal sliding.},

  abstract = {Ice-sheet models used to predict sea-level rise often neglect subglacial hydrology. However, theory and observations suggest that ice flow and subglacial water flow are bidirectionally coupled: ice geometry affects hydraulic potential, hydraulic potential modulates basal shear stress via the basal water pressure, and ice flow advects the subglacial drainage system. This coupling could impact rates of ice mass change but remains poorly understood. We develop a coupled ice–subglacial-hydrology model to investigate the effects of coupling on the long-term evolution of marine-terminating ice sheets. We combine a one-dimensional channelized subglacial hydrology model with a depth-integrated marine-ice-sheet model, incorporating each component of the coupling listed above, yielding a set of differential equations that we solve using a finite-difference, implicit time-stepping approach. We conduct a series of experiments with this model, using either bidirectional or unidirectional coupling. These experiments generate profiles of channel cross-sectional area, channel flow rate, channel effective pressure, ice thickness, and ice velocity. We discuss how the profiles shape one another, resulting in the effective pressure reaching a local maximum in a region near the grounding line. We also describe the impact of bidirectional coupling on the transient retreat of ice sheets through a comparison of our coupled model with ice-flow models that have imposed static basal conditions. We find that including coupled subglacial hydrology leads to grounding-line retreat that is virtually absent when static basal conditions are assumed. This work highlights the role time-evolving subglacial drainage may have in ice-sheet change and informs efforts to include it in ice-sheet models. This work also supplies a physical basis for a commonly used parameterization which assumes that the subglacial water pressure is set by the bed's depth beneath the sea surface.},

  abstract = {Recent seismic studies of ice stream B, Antarctica and field analysis of mid-latitude glacial deposits suggest that deformable basal sediments (e.g., water-saturated till) are important in determining ice sheet flow. If the ratio of till viscosity to effective ice viscosity is small, vertical shear associated with horizontal flow is confined to the deforming bed alone. Ice flow over a deformable bed is thus akin to that of floating ice shelves, because ice shelves flow over inviscid seawater. For some Antarctic ice streams, and possibly for portions of the late Wisconsin ice sheets in North America and Eurasia, basal drag associated with deforming basal sediment does not induce significant vertical gradients of horizontal velocity. Instead, basal drag affects the flow as if it were a horizontal body force balanced by longitudinal and transverse deviatoric stress gradients. Comparison of the observed flow of ice stream B to finite element simulations incorporating a viscous basal till suggest that a simple till rheology is sufficient to explain the current velocity profile. These simulations also highlight the importance of horizontal deviatoric stress in regions where driving stress and basal stress do not locally balance. While bed deformation is critical to ice stream existence, sensitivity tests suggest that ice shelf back pressure is still a crucial control affecting ice stream response to atmospheric and oceanic climate.},

Where relative roughness values are {$<$}5\%, hydraulic roughness can be related to relative roughness using empirically-derived equations such as the Colebrook–White equation. General relationships between hydraulic roughness and relative roughness do not exist for relative roughness {$>$}5\%. Here we report the first quantitative assessment of roughness heights and hydraulic diameters in a subglacial conduit. We measured roughness heights in a 125 m long section of a subglacial conduit using structure-from-motion to produce a digital surface model, and hand-measurements of the b-axis of rocks. We found roughness heights from 0.07 to 0.22 m and cross-sectional areas of 1–2 m2, resulting in relative roughness of 3–12\% and {$>$}5\% for most locations. A simple geometric model of varying conduit diameter shows that when the conduit is small relative roughness is {$>$}30\% and has large variability. Our results suggest that parameterizations of conduit hydraulic roughness in subglacial hydrological models will remain challenging until hydraulic diameters exceed roughness heights by a factor of 20, or the conduit radius is {$>$}1 m for the roughness elements observed here.},

  abstract = {Along the base of glaciers and ice sheets, the sliding of ice over till depends critically on water drainage. In locations where drainage occurs through Röthlisberger channels, the effective pressure along the base of the ice increases and can lead to a strengthening of the bed, which reduces glacier sliding. The formation of Röthlisberger channels depends on two competing effects: (1) melting from turbulent dissipation opens the channel walls and (2) creep flow driven by the weight of the overlying ice closes the channels radially inward. Variation in downstream ice velocity along the channel axis, referred to as an antiplane shear strain rate, decreases the effective viscosity. The softening of the ice increases creep closure velocities. In this way, even a modest addition of antiplane shear can double the size of the Röthlisberger channels for a fixed water pressure or allow channels of a fixed radius to operate at lower effective pressure, potentially decreasing the strength of the surrounding bed. Furthermore, we show that Röthlisberger channels can be deformed away from a circular cross section under applied antiplane shear. These results can have broad impacts on sliding velocities and potentially affect the total ice flux out of glaciers and ice streams.},

  abstract = {Subglacial water modulates glacier velocity across a wide range of space and time scales by influencing friction at the glacier bed. Observations show ice acceleration due to supraglacial lake drainage and water draining through moulins, where both configurations involve water inputs to the bed. Here we consider the reverse: water extraction from the subglacial system. Removing subglacial water results in different dynamics than injecting water, and we hypothesize that understanding 5 these processes will allow for improved characterization of the physics of subglacial hydrology. Water extraction is a proposed intervention method for slowing glaciers that requires significant further investigation before it should be tested or implemented in the field. Here we set up model experiments in the Subglacial Hydrology And Kinetic, Transient Interactions (SHAKTI) model coupled with the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM). By analyzing the problem of an isolated borehole in a background pressure field to determine the region of extraction influence, we find an analytical solution which shows that 10 the water pressure returns to the background value approximately as a logarithm with distance. The benefit of the analytical solution is that the dependence of uncertain parameters is clear and may be used to constrain subglacial hydrology models. We find good agreement between this analytical result and full SHAKTI simulations. Using the coupled SHAKTI-ISSM model, we perform transient model experiments on an idealized tidewater glacier geometry and on Helheim Glacier in Greenland to determine the effects of water extraction on glacier velocity. With continuous pumping, we simulate a modest impact on 15 velocity, which is sensitive to the extraction rate and site location. The response time to pumping initiation and the recovery time following cessation scale according to effective pressure, with typical times on the order of hours to days. These results are encouraging that water extraction is a method of probing the subglacial hydrologic system to better constrain the uncertain physics, with further research required to determine if it is an effective intervention method.},

Ice viscosity is often described by a simple but largely untested and uncalibrated constitutive relation, Glen’s Flow Law, wherein the rate of deformation is proportional to stress raised to the power               n               .

The viscosity and flow rate of ice are therefore more sensitive to changes in stress than most ice-flow models allow.

Here we present a mathematical model for channels underneath ice sheets, which incorporates the detailed mechanics of sediment transport over a mobile till\textasciicircum bed interface, and which allows a variable, wide channel cross section also. The resulting drainage conditions depend on the sediment flux "q) as well as the water flux "Q) through the channel ö these quantities being controlled by the rates at which sediment and meltwater are captured by the flow. An approximate analytical solution indicates a ``canal''-type drainage law "Walder and Fowler, 1994) of the form Ncn /   1Q 5=2q3=2, where Nc is the effective channel pressure, n is the exponent in Glen's flow law for ice, and   is the imposed hydraulic gradient "due to topography). By solving the downstream problem numerically, the canal characteristic has been confirmed and found to be insensitive to upstream conditions. Thus, low effective pressures can result from high basal water flux or melt rates. This supports the contention that canals may be a central component in fast ice flow over soft beds. The proposed model also establishes a fundamental link between the plumbing system of a glacier and its sediment budget.},

We study the injection of one fluid into a planar two-dimensional porous medium containing another, more viscous fluid. We find that the dynamics are distinguished by three regimes: an early-time linearly unstable regime, an intermediate-time nonlinear regime and a late-time single-finger exchange-flow regime. In the first regime, the flow can be linearly unstable to perturbations that grow exponentially. We identify, using linear stability theory and numerical simulations, a critical Péclet number below which the flow remains stable for all times. In the second regime, the flow is dominated by the nonlinear coalescence of fingers which form a mixing zone in which we observe that the convective mixing rate, characterized by a convective Nusselt number, exhibits power-law growth. In this second regime we derive a model for the transversely averaged concentration which shows good agreement with our numerical experiments and extends previous empirical models. Finally, we identify a new final exchange-flow regime in which a pair of counter-propagating diffusive fingers slow exponentially. We derive an analytic solution for this single-finger state which agrees well with numerical simulations. We demonstrate that the flow always evolves to this regime, irrespective of the viscosity ratio and Péclet number, in contrast to previous suggestions.},

  abstract = {The paper attempts to relate four recent sets of measurements on the flow laws of ice: (1) Glen's laboratory compression tests, (2) Gerrard, Perutz \& Roch's pipe experiment on the Jungfraufirn, (3) measurements of contraction rate in a tunnel in Skauthöe Glacier by McCall, and (4) measurements of contraction rate in tunnels in the Z'Mutt and Arolla Glaciers reported by Haefeli \& Kasser. When they are analyzed within the framework of a general flow theory, satisfactory agreement is found between all these results, with one exception: the reported rate of collapse of the Arolla tunnel is faster than would be given by the present theory. The paper includes the theory of the slow collapse of a cylindrical or a spherical hole in a medium showing non-Newtonian viscosity.},

  abstract = {The glacier-dammed Lac des Faverges, located on Glacier de la Plaine Morte (Swiss Alps), has drained annually as a glacier lake outburst flood since 2011. In 2018, the lake volume reached more than 2 × 106 m3, and the resulting flood caused damage to the infrastructure downstream. In 2019, a supraglacial channel was dug to artificially initiate a surface lake drainage, thus limiting the lake water volume and the corresponding hazard. The peak in lake discharge was successfully reduced by over 90 \% compared to 2018. We conducted extensive field measurements of the lake-channel system during the 48 d drainage event of 2019 to characterize its hydraulics and thermodynamics. The derived Darcy–Weisbach friction factor, which characterizes the water flow resistance in the channel, ranges from 0.17 to 0.48. This broad range emphasizes the factor's variability and questions the choice of a constant friction factor in glacio-hydrological models. For the Nusselt number, which relates the channel-wall melt to the water temperature, we show that the classic, empirical Dittus–Boelter equation with the standard coefficients does not adequately represent our measurements, and we propose a suitable pair of coefficients to fit our observations. This hints at the need to continue research into how heat transfer at the ice–water interface is described in the context of glacial hydraulics.},

  abstract = {I present a theoretical and experimental study of floating viscous fluid films introduced into a channel of finite length, motivated by the flow of glacial ice shelves. The dynamics are characterized by a mixture of viscous extensional stresses, transverse shear stresses and a driving buoyancy force. A theory based on a width-integrated model is developed and investigated using analytical, asymptotic and numerical methods. With fluid introduced at a constant rate, the flow is found to approach a steady state with two possible asymptotic forms depending on the length of the channel. For channel lengths less than half the width, the flow is similar to a purely extensional one-dimensional flow, characterized by concave surface profiles and being insensitive to the position of the channel exit (or calving front). Greater lengths result in a more complex asymptotic structure in which the flow adjusts over a short distance towards a prevailing flow of universal dimensionless form. In complete contrast to the extensional regime, the prevailing flow is controlled by the position of the channel exit. Data from a new laboratory experiment involving particle velocimetry of a floating fluid film compares well with the predicted along-channel velocity. Motivated by glaciological application, the analysis is generalized to power-law rheologies and the results used to classify the flow regimes of a selection of ice shelves. The prediction for the frontal speed is in good agreement with geophysical data, indicating that the universal profile predicted by the theory is common in nature.},

Specifically, we study an axisymmetric flow produced by a vertical line source. Close to the source, the flow is controlled viscously, with a balance between radial compressive stresses and hoop stresses. Further out, the flow is driven by gradients in the buoyancy force and is resisted by viscous extensional and hoop stresses. An understanding of these different fluid-mechanical relationships is developed by asymptotic analyses for early times and for the near and far fields at late times. Confirmation of the late-time, far-field behaviour is obtained from a series of laboratory experiments in which golden syrup was injected into denser solutions of potassium carbonate. We use our mathematical solutions to discuss a physical mechanism by which horizontal viscous stresses in a spreading ice shelf, such as those in West Antarctica, can buttress the grounded ice sheet that supplies it.},

To better understand the origin of this topographic form, we combine field observations, laboratory experiments, analysis of a high-resolution topographic map and mathematical theory to quantitatively characterize a class of physical phenomena that produce amphitheatre-shaped heads. The resulting geometric growth equation accurately predicts the shape of decimetre-wide channels in laboratory experiments, 100 m-wide valleys in Florida and Idaho, and kilometre-wide valleys on Mars.

  abstract = {The influence of hydrologic transience and heterogeneity on basal motion is an often-neglected aspect of numerical ice-flow models. We present a flow-band model of glacier dynamics with a Coulomb friction sliding law that is coupled to a model of the basal drainage system by means of subglacial water pressure. The ice-flow model contains “higher-order” stress gradients from the Stokes flow approximation originally conceived by Blatter (1995). The resulting system of nonlinear equations is solved using a modified Picard iteration that is shown to improve the rate of convergence. A parameterization of lateral shearing is included to account for the effects of three-dimensional geometry. We find that lateral drag has a discernible effect on glacier speed even when glacier width exceeds glacier length. Variations in flow-band width are shown to have a greater influence on flow line speed than either different valley cross-sectional shapes or the presence or absence of glacier sliding along valley walls. Modeled profiles of subglacial water pressure depart significantly from pressures prescribed as a uniform fraction of overburden, thus producing profiles of glacier sliding that are distinctly different from those that would be described by a sliding law controlled by overburden pressures. Simulations of hydraulically driven glacier acceleration highlight the value of including a representation of basal hydrology in models aiming for improved predictive capability of glacier dynamics.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Water flowing in tubular channels inside a glacier produces frictional heat, which causes melting of the ice walls. However the channels also have a tendency to close under the overburden pressure. Using the equilibrium equation that at every cross-section as much ice is melted as flows in, differential equations are given for steady flow in horizontal, inclined and vertical channels at variable depth and for variable discharge, ice properties and channel roughness. It is shown that the pressure decreases with increasing discharge, which proves that water must flow in main arteries. The same argument is used to show that certain glacier lakes above long flat valley glaciers must form in times of low discharge and empty when the discharge is high, i.e. when the water head in the subglacial drainage system drops below the lake level. Under the conditions of the model an ice mass of uniform thickness does not float, i.e. there is no water layer at the bottom, when the bed is inclined in the down-hill direction, but it can float on a horizontal bed if the exponent               n               of the law for the ice creep is small. It is further shown that basal streams (bottom conduits) and lateral streams at the hydraulic grade line (gradient conduits) can coexist. Time-dependent flow, local topography, ice motion, and sediment load are not accounted for in the theory, although they may strongly influence the actual course of the water. Computations have been carried out for the Gornergletscher where the bed topography is known and where some data are available on subglacial water pressure.                        ,              Résumé                            La condition suivante est admise: le rétrécissement de la conduite sous-glaciaire dû à la pression de la glace est compensé par la fusion provoquée par la transformation en chaleur des pertes de charge. Des équations différentielles pour l’écoulement slationnaire dans des conduites horizontales, inclinées et verticales en fonction de la profondeur en dessous de la surface du glacier, du débit, des propriétés de la glace et de la rugosité des parois de la conduite sont indiquées. Ainsi, il s’est avéré que la pression décroît lorsque le débit augmente, ce qui prouverait que l’eau s’écoule dans des artères principales. Une argumentation analogue montre que certains lacs de barrage glaciaire situés au-dessus d’une langue de glacier étendue doivent se former lorsque le débit est faible et se vident lorsque le débil est élevé, c’est-à-dire lorsque la ligne de charge du système de drainage sous-glaciaire descend en dessous du niveau du lac. Selon les hypothèses du modèle, une masse de glace d’épaisseur uniforme ne flotte pas, c’est-à-dire, il n’y a pas de couche d’eau au fond lorsque le lit est incliné vers l’aval mais elle peut flotter sur un lit horizontal lorsque l’exposant               n               dans l’équation de fluage de la glace est petit. On montre que l’écoulement sous-glaciaire au “thalweg” et l’écoulement latéral le long de la ligne de charge peuvent être stables tous deux l’un à côté de l’autre. La variabilité dans le temps du débit ainsi que la topographie locale, les propriétés de la glace et le transport solide ne font pas partie de la théorie, mais ont certainement une grande influence sur le site de l’écoulement. Des calculs ont été effectués pour le Gornergletscher où la topographie du lit est connue et où il existe des mesures de la pression d’eau sous-glaciaire.                        ,              Zusammenfassung                            Das in röhrenformigen Gerinnen im Gletsehcrinnern fliessende Wasser erzeugt Reibungswärme, wodurch an den Wandungen Eis wegschmilzt. Die Gerinne haben andererseits die Tendenz, sich unter dem Überlagerungsdruck zu schliessen. Mittels der Gleichgewichtsbedingung, dass in jedem Querschnitt gleichviel Eis wegschmilzt wie zufliesst werden Differentialgleichungen hergeleitet, die den Wasserdruck in Funktion der Überlagerung, der Abflussmenge, der Zähigkeit des Eises und der Rauhigkeit des Gerinnes für den Fall horizontaler, vertikaler und beliebig geneigter Röhren im stationären Zustand zu berechnen erlauben. Es wird gezeigt, dass der Druck mit zunehmender Durchflussmenge abnimmt, was bedeutet, dass sich das Wasser in Hauptadern sammeln muss. Aus dem gleichen Grund werden sich gewisse Gletscherseen oberhalb langer flacher Talgletscher zur Zeit geringen Abflusses füllen, während die Entleerung bei starkem Abfluss einsetzt, wenn also der Druckspiegel des subglazialen Drainagesystems unter den Seespiegel fällt. Eine Eismasse konstanter Mächtigkeit kann bei den für die Modellrechnung getroffenen Voraussetzungen nicht zum schwimmen kommen, d. h. es ist keine durchgehende Wasserschicht an der Gletscherunterfläche vorhanden, wenn das Glelscherbett talwärts geneigt ist. Bei horizontalem Belt könnte sich aber eine solche Wasserschicht bei kleinem Exponenten               n               des Fliessgesetzes des Eises einstellen. Die Rechnung zeigt weiter, dass sowohl zentrale Gerinne (an der Basis des Gletschers im Talweg) als auch laterale Gerinne (längs der Energielinie) nebeneinander bestehen können. Weder zeitliche Änderungen des Abflusses, noch topographische Effekte an der Gletschersohle, Eisbewegung oder Sedimeni-führung werden dabei in der Theorie berücksichtigt, obschon diese Faktoren zweifelsohne den wirklichen Verlauf der subglazialen Wasserläufe mitbestimmen. Für den Gornergletscher, von dem ausser dem Sohlenprofil vereinzelte Werte des subglazialen Wasserdruckes zur Verfügung standen, sind Berechnungen durchgeführt worden.},

  abstract = {Basal sliding is one of the most important components in the dynamics of fast–flowing glaciers, but remains poorly understood on a theoretical level. In this paper, the problem of glacier sliding with cavitation over hard beds is addressed in detail. First, a bound on drag generated by the bed is derived for arbitrary bed geometries. This bound shows that the commonly used sliding law,               τ               b               =                                Cu                 m                              b                                N                 n                              , cannot apply to beds with bounded slopes. In order to resolve the issue of a realistic sliding law, we consider the classical Nye–Kamb sliding problem, extended to cover the case of cavitation but neglecting regelation. Based on an analogy with contact problems in elasticity, we develop a method which allows solutions to be constructed for any finite number of cavities per bed period. The method is then used to find sliding laws for irregular hard beds, and to test previously developed theories for calculating the drag generated by beds on which obstacles of many different sizes are present. It is found that the maximum drag attained is controlled by those bed obstacles which have the steepest slopes.},

  abstract = {We present a continuum model for melt water drainage through a spatially distributed system of connected subglacial cavities, and consider in this context the complications introduced when effective pressure or water pressure drops to zero. Instead of unphysically allowing water pressure to become negative, we model the formation of a partially vapour- or air-filled space between ice and bed. Likewise, instead of allowing sustained negative effective pressures, we allow ice to separate from the bed at zero effective pressure. The resulting model is a free boundary problem in which an elliptic obstacle problem determines hydraulic potential, and therefore also determines regions of zero effective pressure and zero water pressure. This is coupled with a transport problem for stored water, and the coupled system bears some similarities with Hele-Shaw and squeeze-film models. We present a numerical method for computing time-dependent solutions, and find close agreement with semi-analytical travelling wave and steady-state solutions. As may be expected, we find that ice–bed separation is favoured by high fluxes and low ice surface slopes and low bed slopes, while partially filled cavities are favoured by low fluxes and high slopes. At the boundaries of regions with zero water or effective pressure, discontinuities in water level are frequently present, either in the form of propagating shocks or as stationary hydraulic jumps accompanied by discontinuities in potential gradient.},

Under suitable assumptions about basal slip in the contact areas, the boundary-layer structure for this problem replicates the boundary layers previously identified for marine ice sheets from depth-integrated models and confirms the results of these previous models: the interior of the grounded ice sheet can be modelled as a standard free-surface lubrication flow, while coupling with the membrane-like floating ice shelf leads to two boundary conditions on this lubrication flow model at the contact line. These boundary conditions determine ice thickness and ice flux at the contact line and allow the lubrication flow model with a contact line to be solved as a moving boundary problem. In addition, we find that the continuous transition of vertical velocity from grounded to floating ice requires the presence of two previously unidentified boundary layers. One of these takes the form of a viscous beam, in which a wave-like surface feature leads to a continuous transition in surface slope from grounded to floating ice, while the other provides boundary conditions on this viscous beam at the contact line.},

  abstract = {Free-surface thin-film flows can principally be described by two types of models. Lubrication models assume that shear stresses are dominant in the force balance of the flow and are appropriate where there is little or no slip at the base of the flow. Conversely, membrane or ‘free-film’ models are appropriate in situations where there is rapid slip and normal (or extensional) stresses play a significant role in force balance. In some physical applications, notably in glaciology, both rapid and slow slip can occur within the same fluid film. In order to capture the dynamics of rapid and slow slip in a single model that describes the entire fluid film, a hybrid of membrane and lubrication models is therefore required. Several of these hybrid models have been constructed on an ad hoc basis in glaciology, where they are usually termed ‘higher order models’. Here, we present a self-consistent asymptotic analysis of the most common of these models due originally to Blatter. We show that Blatter’s model reproduces the solution to the underlying Stokes equations to second order in the film’s aspect ratio, regardless of the amount of slip at the base of the fluid. In doing so, we also construct asymptotic expansions for the Stokes equations to this order for shear-thinning power-law fluids, paying particular attention to a high-viscosity boundary layer that develops at the free surface when there is little or no slip at the base. Lastly, we demonstrate that a depth-integrated hybrid model of comparable accuracy to Blatter’s model—which cannot be depth integrated—can also be constructed, which we suggest as a viable tool for numerical simulations of thin films that contain both slowly and rapidly sliding parts.},

A general model describing the evolution of two fluids on an inclined substrate is developed and explored to reveal a rich variety of flow regimes for different modes of release. The asymptotic reduction of this problem due to the dominance of the along-slope component of gravity is shown to yield considerable analytical inroads compared with previous studies of multi-layer flow configurations, which have focused exclusively on the case of horizontal beds. For the canonical example in which two fluids are introduced at a constant flux, the flow forms two regions: an upstream region containing both fluids, and a downstream region comprised purely of the lighter fluid, with a sharp intervening jump in thicknesses between the two. By constructing similarity solutions, we establish a full regime diagram of the possible configurations over all asymptotic limits of the viscosity, flux and density ratios. For the release of two fixed volumes of fluid, the layers separate completely into two disjoint but connected regions, contrasting in essential structure from the constant flux case. Even a small volume of the heavier fluid is able to significantly accelerate the propagation of the lighter fluid in front of it. Excellent agreement is found between our theoretical predictions and the results of a series of laboratory experiments.},

  abstract = {Turbulence and heat transfer are two critical factors in the chain of world energy consumption. Hence, development of more efficient energy transfer techniques in engineering applications through control and optimization of the thermal turbulent boundary layer and turbulence continues to be a subject of intense interest. This is why reviewing a passive flow control technique with a focus on unique characteristics of heat transfer in devices called riblets is beneficial as technology pushes to revolutionize design and manufacturing of heat exchanger equipment. Riblet surfaces are considered beneficial to many commercial applications as they reduce forces between surface and fluid, and in some cases can enhance heat transfer in the turbulent flow regime. As there is no literature study that focuses on heat transfer and riblets, the current study reports experimental and numerical investigations reviewing both drag reduction and heat transfer using riblets in closed and open channels. Drag reduction studies are limited to water and oil flow studies, and heat transfer studies are expanded to air flow studies as there are none on water or oil flow. In addition, physical mechanisms of fluid drag and convective heat transfer are discussed. This paper outlines the challenges of fabricating riblets and provides a design summary for optimal drag reduction and heat transfer. This review also looks at applied numerical methods and their accuracy in evaluating drag reduction and heat transfer over riblet surfaces. The important findings and a possible future optimization approach on riblet surfaces are highlighted as well.},

  abstract = {Subglacial hydrology has a strong influence on glacier and ice sheet dynamics, particularly through the dependence of sliding velocity on subglacial water pressure. Significant challenges are involved in modeling subglacial hydrology, as the drainage geometry and flow mechanics are constantly changing, with complex feedbacks that play out between water and ice. A clear tradition has been established in the subglacial hydrology modeling literature of distinguishing between channelized (efficient) and sheetlike (inefficient or distributed) drainage systems or components and using slightly different forms of the governing equations in each subsystem to represent the dominant physics. Specifically, many previous subglacial hydrology models disregard opening by melt in the sheetlike system or redistribute it to adjacent channel elements in order to avoid runaway growth that occurs when it is included in the sheetlike system. We present a new subglacial hydrology model, SHAKTI (Subglacial Hydrology and Kinetic, Transient Interactions), in which a single set of governing equations is used everywhere, including opening by melt in the entire domain. SHAKTI employs a generalized relationship between the subglacial water flux and the hydraulic gradient that allows for the representation of laminar, turbulent, and transitional regimes depending on the local Reynolds number. This formulation allows for the coexistence of these flow regimes in different regions, and the configuration and geometry of the subglacial system evolves naturally to represent sheetlike drainage as well as systematic channelized drainage under appropriate conditions. We present steady and transient example simulations to illustrate the features and capabilities of the model and to examine sensitivity to mesh size and time step size. The model is implemented as part of the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM).},

We present a two-way coupled framework to simulate the nonlinear feedbacks of evolving subglacial hydrology and ice dynamics using the Subglacial Hydrology And Kinetic, Transient Interactions (SHAKTI) model within the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM). Through coupled simulations of Helheim Glacier, we find that terminus effects dominate the seasonal velocity pattern up to 15 km from the terminus, while hydrology drives the velocity response upstream. With increased melt, the hydrology influence yields seasonal acceleration of several hundred meters per year in the interior, suggesting that hydrology will play an important role in future mass balance of tidewater glaciers.},

The model is forced with daily surface runoff estimates for 2009 and 2010 across an 8,000-km2 region on the western margin. The overall subglacial drainage system morphology develops similarly in both years, with subglacial channel networks growing inland from the ice sheet margin and robust subglacial pathways forming over bedrock ridges. Modeled effective pressures are compared to contemporaneous regional surface speeds derived from TerraSAR-X imagery to investigate spatial relationships. Our results show an inverse spatial relationship between effective pressure and ice speed in the mid-melt season, when surface speeds are elevated, indicating that effective pressure is the dominant control on surface velocities in the mid-melt season. By contrast, in the early and late melt seasons, when surface speeds are slower, effective pressure and surface speed have a positive relationship. Our results suggest that outside of the mid-melt season, the influence of effective pressures on sliding speeds may be secondary to the influence of driving stress and spatially variable bed roughness.},

  abstract = {Ice sheet flow is strongly influenced by the nature and quantity of meltwater entering the subglacial system. Accessing and monitoring contemporary drainage systems beneath ice sheets is notoriously difficult, but it is possible to utilise the exposed beds of palaeo-ice sheets. In particular, eskers record deposition in glacial drainage channels and are widespread on the exposed beds of former ice sheets. However, unlike some other common glacial landforms (e.g. drumlins) there have been relatively few attempts to investigate and quantify their characteristics at the ice sheet scale. This paper presents data on the distribution, pattern, and morphometry of a large ({$>$}20,000) sample of eskers in Canada, formed under the Laurentide Ice Sheet, including quantification of their length, fragmentation, sinuosity, lateral spacing, number of tributaries, and downstream elevation changes. Results indicate that eskers are typically very long (hundreds of km) and often very straight (mean sinuosity approximates 1). We interpret these long esker systems to reflect time-transgressive formation in long, stable conduits under hydrostatic pressure. The longest eskers (in the Keewatin sector) are also the least fragmented, which we interpret to reflect formation at an ice margin experiencing stable and gradual retreat. In many locations, the lateral distance between neighbouring eskers is remarkably consistent and results indicate a preferred spacing of around 12 km, consistent with numerical models which predict esker spacing of 8e25 km. In other locations, typically over soft sediments, eskers are rarer and their patterns are more chaotic, reflecting fewer large R-channels and rapidly changing ice sheet dynamics. Comparison of esker patterns with an existing ice margin chronology reveals that the meltwater drainage system evolved during deglaciation: eskers became more closely spaced with fewer tributaries as deglaciation progressed, which has been interpreted to reflect increased meltwater supply from surface melt. Eskers show no preference to trend up or down slopes, indicating that ice surface was an important control on their location and that the conduits were, in places, close to ice overburden pressure.},

Comparison of results with initial value solutions of the partial differential equations shows that, excluding short times, there is good agreement between the two theories. Comparison of the theory with several experiments in the literature indicates that the theory gives a good prediction of the most dangerous wavelength of unstable fingers.

  abstract = {We develop theoretically a description of a possible subglacial drainage mechanism for glaciers and ice sheets moving over saturated, deformable till. The model is based on the plausible assumption that flow of water in a thin film at the ice-till interface is unstable to the formation of a channelized drainage system, and is restricted to the case in which meltwater cannot escape through the till to an underlying aquifer. In describing the physics of such channelized drainage, we have generalized and extended Rothlisberger's model of channels cut into basal ice to include "canals" cut into the till, paying particular attention to the role of sediment properties and the mechanics of sediment transport. We show that sediment-floored Rothlisberger (R) channels can exist for high effective pressures, and wide, shallow, ice-roofed canals cut into the till for low effective pressures. Canals should form a distributed, non-arborescent system, unlike R channels. For steep slopes typical of alpine glaciers, both drainage systems can exist, but with the water pressure lower in the R channels than in the canals; the canal drainage should therefore be unstable in the presence of channels. For small slopes typical of ice sheets, only canals can exist and we therefore predict that, if channelized meltwater flow occurs under ice sheets moving over deformable till, it takes the form of shallow, distributed canals at low effective pressure, similar to that measured at Ice Stream B in West Antarctica. Geologic evidence derived from land forms and deposits left by the Pleistocene ice sheets in North America and Europe is also consistent with predictions of the model.},

The least efficient component of the system is a `distributed' uniform sheet flow everywhere beneath the ice, whereas the `channelised' drainage through large, thermally eroded conduits is more efficient. To understand the conditions under which the subglacial network channelises, we perform a linear stability analysis of distributed flow, considering competition between thermal erosion and viscous ice collapse. We derive a stability criterion and determine the minimum subglacial meltwater flux needed for channels to form. We demonstrate the need to include lateral heat diffusion when modeling melt incision to resolve channel widths. We also show that low numerical resolution can suppress channel formation and lead to overestimates of water pressure. We demonstrate the applicability of linear stability results to predicting the character of subglacial hydrological networks without recourse to numerical modeling.},

The shallow shelf approximation (SSA) provides a convenient way to obtain closed-form approximations of the velocity and flux in a rapidly sliding ice stream when the basal drag is much less than the driving stress. However, the validity of the SSA approximation breaks down when the magnitude of the basal drag increases. Here we find a more accurate expression for the velocity and flux in this transitional regime before vertical deformation fully dominates, in agreement with numerical results. The closed-form expressions we derive can be incorporated into wider modelling efforts to yield a better characterisation of ice stream dynamics, and inform the use of the SSA in large-scale simulations.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of glacial sliding over water-saturated tills are poorly constrained and difficult to capture realistically in large-scale models. Experiments characterize till as a plastic material with a pressure-dependent yield stress, but the subglacial water pressure may fluctuate on annual to daily timescales, leading to transient adjustment of the till. We construct a continuum two-phase model of coupled fluid and solid deformation, describing the movement of water through the pore space of a till that is itself dilating and deforming. By forcing the model with time-dependent effective pressure at the ice–till interface, we infer the resulting relationships between basal traction, solid fraction and rate of deformation. We find that shear dilation introduces internal pressure variations and transient dilatant strengthening emerges, leading to hysteretic behaviour in low-permeability materials. The result is a time-dependent effective sliding law, with permeability-dependent lag between changes in effective pressure and the slidingspeed. This deviation from traditional steady-state sliding laws may play an important role in a wide range of transient ice-sheet phenomena, from glacier surges to the tidal response of ice streams.},

They are present in many Antarctic ice shelves and can reduce ice-shelf structural integrity, potentially destabilizing ice shelves by full-depth incision. Here, we describe the viscous ice response to a basal channel—secondary flow—which acts perpendicular to the channel axis and is induced by gradients in ice thickness. We use a full-Stokes ice-flow model to systematically assess the transient evolution of a basal channel in the presence of melting. Secondary flow increases with channel size and reduces the rate of channel incision, such that linear extrapolation or the Shallow-Shelf Approximation cannot project future channel evolution. For thick ice shelves ( m) secondary flow potentially stabilizes the channel, but is insufficient to significantly delay breakthrough for thinner ice ( m). Using synthetic data, we assess the impact of secondary flow when inferring basal-channel melt rates from satellite observations.},

  abstract = {The theory of the flow of water at the base of a glacier is reviewed and extended. A detailed analysis is made of flow through Röthlisberger channels. (Röthlisberger channels are channels at the base of a glacier that are incised upward into the ice mass.) It is shown that, in general, a pressure gradient drives water melted from the bottom surface of a glacier away from Röthlisberger channels. Thus these channels are not good collectors of the water produced at the bottom surface of a glacier or ice sheet. If Nye channels exist (Nye channels are incised downward into the bedrock of a glacier bed), they should be important in the discharge of water at the base of a glacier. Nye tributary channels are expected to be spaced over several hundred meters apart. The analysis indicates that sheet flow is the main mechanism by which water melted from the bottom ice surface flows out of a glacier or ice sheet. The sheet flow described in this paper is a modification of that considered in our earlier papers. The thickness of the present sheets is not roughly uniform, but rather squeezes to negligible values at high-pressure zones, where ice moves over the upstream side of obstacles and irregularities in the bed. The pressure of the water in the sheets is lower than the ice overburden pressure. The difference between the pressure in the sheets and the ice overburden pressure is estimated with the aid of the recent major refinements to glacier sliding theory made by J. F. Nye and by B. Kamb. (L. Lliboutry made the original suggestion that the pressure of the water at the base of a glacier is smaller than the ice overburden pressure.) Analysis indicates that a single Röthlisberger channel runs down the center of a glacier over a major fraction of its length. Pressure gradients, produced by the concave shape of the transverse bed profile, exist that drive water in the sheet toward this channel. However, in the upper parts of a glacier, this channel may take the form of a thick water layer of finite breadth.},

  abstract = {Walder recently analyzed the initial instability of water flow in a sheet under a glacier that is produced by greater heat production in the flowing water and thus the larger rate of ice melting where a perturbation has increased the water sheet thickness. We have looked at the problem from the other presumed jinal state. We assume that instabilities have finally caused all the water to flow in channels (R -channels) at the bed. We investigated whether these channels can collect enough of the water that is produced by the geothermal heat and the heat slidin g to remain in existence. When a basal shear stress is present, the distance out to which a channel can collect wa ter is not that much greater than the channel radius itself. It is concluded that it is not lik ely for the cha nnel to be able to collect appreciable amounts of water that is produced at the bed. Hence despite the indication that a n instability initially might grow in a water sheet, this instability either cannot develop to the point when the water flow is primarily in channels or else the water flow a ltern ates cyclically between a state primarily of sheet flow and a sta te of channel flow. It would appear that the channels that do exist under a glacier have their primary o rigin in the melt water from the upper surface that pours down moulins and thus is already chan nelized by the time it reaches the bed.},

  abstract = {We present a two-dimensional Glacier Drainage System model (GlaDS) that couples distributed and channelized subglacial water flow. Distributed flow occurs through linked cavities that are represented as a continuous water sheet of variable thickness. Channelized flow occurs through Röthlisberger channels that can form on any of the edges of a prescribed, unstructured network of potential channels. Water storage is accounted for in an englacial aquifer and in moulins, which also act as point sources of water to the subglacial system. Solutions are presented for a synthetic topography designed to mimic an ice sheet margin. For low discharge, all the flow is accommodated in the sheet, whereas for sufficiently high discharge, the model exhibits a channelization instability which leads to the formation of a self-organized channel system. The random orientation of the network edges allows the channel system geometry to be relatively unbiased, in contrast to previous structured grid-based models. Under steady conditions, the model supports the classical view of the subglacial drainage system, with low pressure regions forming around the channels. Under diurnally varying input, water flows in and out of the channels, and a rather complex spatiotemporal pattern of water pressures is predicted. We explore the effects of parameter variations on the channel system topology and mean effective pressure. The model is then applied to a mountain glacier and forced with meltwater calculated by a temperature index model. The results are broadly consistent with our current understanding of the glacier drainage system and demonstrate the applicability of the model to real settings.},

It is derived from the Parallel Ice Sheet Model (Bueler and Brown, 2009). Velocities are calculated by superposition of two shallow stress balance approximations within the entire ice covered region: the shallow ice approximation (SIA) is dominant in grounded regions and accounts for shear deformation parallel to the geoid. The plug-flow type shallow shelf approximation (SSA) dominates the velocity field in ice shelf regions and serves as a basal sliding velocity in grounded regions. Ice streams can be identified diagnostically as regions with a significant contribution of membrane stresses to the local momentum balance. All lateral boundaries in PISM-PIK are free to evolve, including the grounding line and ice fronts. Ice shelf margins in particular are modeled using Neumann boundary conditions for the SSA equations, reflecting a hydrostatic stress imbalance along the vertical calving face. The ice front position is modeled using a subgrid-scale representation of calving front motion (Albrecht et al., 2011) and a physically-motivated calving law based on horizontal spreading rates. The model is tested in experiments from the Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project (MISMIP). A dynamic equilibrium simulation of Antarctica under present-day conditions is presented in Martin et al. (2011).},

We know that friction, ice stream velocity, and water pressure at the ice bed all matter, but we still do not know how to represent the process over both hard beds (which are solid rock) and soft ones (composed of unconsolidated erosion products called till). Zoet and Iverson present experimental results describing how glacial ice moves over watersaturated till (see the Perspective by Minchew and Joughin). These observations should help to solve the long-standing problem of constructing a generalized slip law that combines the processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.

Flow models of the ice sheet and till-bedded glaciers elsewhere require a law that relates slip resistance, slip velocity, and water pressure at the bed. We present results of experiments in which pressurized ice at its melting temperature is slid over a water-saturated till bed. Steady-state slip resistance increases with slip velocity owing to sliding of ice across the bed, but above a threshold velocity, till shears at its rate-independent Coulomb strength. These results motivate a generalized slip law for glacier-flow models that combines processes of hard-bedded sliding and bed deformation.},
